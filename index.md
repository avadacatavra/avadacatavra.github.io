## About me

I’m a privacy and security researcher in Pittsburgh, PA. Currently, I’m focused on Mixed (Augmented and Virtual) Reality. I also dabble in [Rust](https://rustlang.org) and [Servo](https://servo.org).

In my free time, I enjoy bouldering, yoga, traveling, and using Oxford commas.  [We](https://ricky.hosfelt.io) have two cats, [Batman](./assets/batman.jpg) and [Watson](./assets/watson.jpeg), who are the cutest cats in the world.
