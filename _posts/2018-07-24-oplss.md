# OPLSS (A Review Partially Told in Gifs)
I recently returned from the Oregon Programming Languages Summer School, which was two and a half weeks of trying to smush a ridiculous amount of knowledge into my brain.

I decided to attend OPLSS because I would read these PL papers…and be completely confused. They were completely indecipherable to me. I’ve revisited some of these papers since getting home and I already understand so much more. Some main takeaways for me:

- $$\lambda$$-calculus isn’t as terrifying as I thought
- I have a lot of bedtime reading, starting with [PFPL](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/pfpl/2nded.pdf)
- There’s a language to talk about languages (aka the entire [Foundations](http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer18/lectures/foundations_notes.pdf) week)!
- Types are specifications of behavior…and specifications are programs (see Computational Type Theory)--I can’t honestly say that I’ve processed anything from these lectures yet…

I was pleasantly surprised that I’ve had exposure to some terms and concepts just by using Rust. Overall, it was a great experience. I’m glad to be home (not so glad to work through my Github notifications and email). I appreciate the exposure to all of these PL concepts that I wouldn’t have been aware of otherwise, and I can’t wait to dive in more.

Stay tuned—I’m finishing up a few things that are stuck in my backlog (looking at you [performance metrics](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/20459)), then I’m hoping to dive into some more work on [formal verification](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/announcing-the-formal-verification-working-group/7240/11).

A huge thank you to **everyone** involved in OPLSS—organizers, lecturers, participants—it was a pleasure to meet you all, and I hope to collaborate/run into you again someday!


## Highlights

Location: Aside from the heat wave (and no A/C), Oregon was great. There’s maybe a bit too much nature for a dedicated indoorswoman like me, but overall, highly recommend. Specifically, Eugene has a wonderful store called Hirons that is simultaneously indescribable and also capable of fulfilling your every need. I bought allergy medication, a pineapple cup, *and* a swan floatie named George<sup>[1](#georgefootnote)</sup> there.

People: it turns out that there are a lot of brilliant and lovely people doing PL research (And if any of you want to do Rust-related work, hmu)!

Participant Talks: Some nights, we had informal participant lectures, where anyone could share their research

Events: I had the pleasure of meeting Bob Harper—with a balloon that said “Die Already” and a shiny birthday tiara. It was literally the first time I’d ever met him. OPLSS hosted a surprise birthday party for Bob, and I somehow ended up organizing and greeting him. At the aforementioned Hirons, Zena and I acquired some balloons with questionable messages (“Happy Birthday--I hate you,” “Die Already,” “Grow Up,” “You’re Old,” etc.) for decor—that’s how everyone wants to be greeted, right? With a stranger holding a tiara and a mean balloon?

There were *many* more topics (I haven’t even included anything from the week of Foundations of PL)--you can see all of the details [here](http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer18/topics.php). My notes are…scattered around my computer, notebook, and iPad, because I kept breaking things, so I recommend checking out [participant notes](https://github.com/OPLSS/oplss-notes-2018).

## Rust Specific

Aaron Turon gave a talk about (PL-heavy) open research projects in Rust, so I’ll spread the word here too:


- [Chalk](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/chalk): describe Rust trait system in terms of logic
- [Polonius](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/polonius): [model](http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2018/04/27/an-alias-based-formulation-of-the-borrow-checker/) the borrow checker
- [Const-dependent types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1931):  there’s work on both the compiler and in Chalk—pop into #wg-traits on Discord to find out more
