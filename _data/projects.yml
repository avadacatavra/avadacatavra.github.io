    I’m research engineer focused on security and privacy in Mixed Reality–I lead privacy and safety efforts for a Social VR product, [Hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com/), as well as [Firefox Reality](https://mixedreality.mozilla.org/firefox-reality/). I work across the mixed reality teams to ensure that our products are respectful and empowering for users. In my research, I investigate emerging privacy threats and determine both technical and non-technical solutions and mitigations.
